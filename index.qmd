Welcome! My name is Luke Snavely, and I am a rising junior and presidential scholar at Robert Morris University, completing my undergrad in Statistics and Data Science. I am working towards my Masters in Data Science and a minor in Data Analytics.

I serve as the president of RMU's Sport Analytics Club, presenting on relevant sport analytical topics every month. Through this position, I attend and present at conferences, like the Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference, compete in hackathons, and develop my R coding skills.

I also serve as the president of RMU's Men's Club Soccer team. Growing up near Pittsburgh and playing soccer and baseball, I am a huge sports fan!
